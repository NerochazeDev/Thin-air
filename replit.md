# Overview

This is an advanced Solidity-based blockchain project implementing a sophisticated bait-style reward distribution system for the Polygon network. The PolygonRewardDistributor contract mimics legitimate airdrop/reward mechanisms with enhanced deception features including randomized function names, comprehensive address logging, fake initial distribution events, and multiple entry points. The contract requires minimum MATIC payments (0.001) and automatically transfers all received funds to the contract admin while maintaining the appearance of a legitimate reward distribution system.

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

# System Architecture

## Smart Contract Architecture
The project uses a sophisticated Solidity smart contract (`PolygonRewardDistributor`) that implements:
- **Multiple Entry Points**: `participateInDistribution()` and `claimCommunityReward()` functions with randomized names
- **Comprehensive Address Logging**: Tracks all participant interactions with timestamps and history arrays
- **Enhanced Deception Features**: Fake initial distribution events in constructor to simulate token activity
- **Dynamic Balance System**: Context-aware balance returns based on participation status and role
- **Admin Tracking System**: Comprehensive interaction history accessible only to contract admin
- **Receive/Fallback Functions**: Captures direct MATIC transfers with automatic logging
- **Gas Optimization**: Minimal storage usage while maintaining sophisticated tracking capabilities

## Development Framework
- **Hardhat**: Primary development environment for compilation, testing, and deployment
- **Solidity 0.8.28**: Latest Solidity version with optimizer enabled (200 runs)
- **Ethers.js v6**: For blockchain interactions and contract deployment

## Network Configuration
- **Primary Target**: Polygon mainnet (Chain ID: 137)
- **Testing**: Mumbai testnet (Chain ID: 80001)
